## How to Run

Run the command `python matchthetiles.py` inside the folder `src` and a menu should be displayed.

## The Solver

The `Solver` menu displays all the available levels to test and after choosing a level, a new menu is presented with all the search algorithms implemented (BFS, DFS, UCS, Greedy and A*).
After all this selections, it's presented the initial board (it is playable using the arrow keys) and data about the search (time elapsed, number of moves, moves, expanded nodes, blocks and goals).

## How to Play

Swipe (Up, Down, Left, Right) using the arrow keys to move the tiles. You should place all colored tiles onto the designated spots with the same color. The moves are synchronized, thus you must use existing fixed tiles to create gaps between tiles and solve the puzzle.

In Normal Mode there are 20 available levels and in Advanced Mode there are 22 available levels.
