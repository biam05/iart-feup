> Each group must submit in Moodle a brief presentation (max. 5 slides), in PDF format, which will be used in the class to analyze, together with the teacher, the progress of the work. The presentation should contain: (1) specification of the work to be performed (definition of the machine learning problem to address); (2) related work with references to works found in a bibliographic search (articles, web pages and/or source code); (3) description of the tools and algorithms to use in the assignment; and (4) implementation work already carried out.
